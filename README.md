# Early Disease Detection
A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health indicators.

## Overview
Developed classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM) to detect heart disease using medical and demographic data.  
Performed EDA, data preprocessing, and model evaluation to identify key risk factors.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Key Features
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization  
- Model training and comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Insights into significant predictors of heart disease  

## Results
Achieved strong model performance and highlighted health factors most associated with disease risk.
